# m7_direct_kinematics

Meta computational graph composed by direct kinematics computation for xArm6.

### ID
m7

### Description
A meta computational graph that uses [moveit2](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2) to compute direct kinematics for a UFACTORY xArm6 manipulator. Used to demonstrate a complex tranformation using the [geometry2](https://github.com/ros2/geometry2) package.
