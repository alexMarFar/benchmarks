description: 'A meta computational graph that uses [moveit2](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2)
  to compute inverse kinematics with the [LMA](https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/doc/examples/kinematics_configuration/kinematics_configuration_tutorial.html#the-lma-kinematics-plugin) 
  plugin for a UFACTORY xArm6 manipulator. Used to demonstrate a complex tranformation using the [geometry2](https://github.com/ros2/geometry2) package.'
