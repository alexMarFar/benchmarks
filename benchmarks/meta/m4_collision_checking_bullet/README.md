# m4_collision_checking_bullet

CMeta computational graph composed by collision checking between xArm6 and a box using Bullet library.

### ID
m4

### Description
A meta computational graph that uses [moveit2](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2) to compute collision checking with the [Bullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) library between a UFACTORY xArm6 manipulator and a cube-shaped collision object. Used to demonstrate a complex tranformation using the [geometry2](https://github.com/ros2/geometry2) package.
