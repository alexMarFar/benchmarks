description: 'A meta computational graph that uses [moveit2](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2)
  to compute collision checking with the [Bullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) library between a UFACTORY xArm6 manipulator and a cube-shaped collision object. 
  Used to demonstrate a complex tranformation using the [geometry2](https://github.com/ros2/geometry2) package.'
