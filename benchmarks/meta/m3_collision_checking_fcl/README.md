# m3_collision_checking_fcl


Meta computational graph composed by collision checking between xArm6 and a box using FCL library.

### ID
m3

### Description
A computational graph that uses [moveit2](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2) to compute collision checking with the [FCL](https://github.com/flexible-collision-library/fcl) library between a UFACTORY xArm6 manipulator and a cube-shaped collision object.
Used to demonstrate a complex tranformation using the [geometry2](https://github.com/ros2/geometry2) package.
