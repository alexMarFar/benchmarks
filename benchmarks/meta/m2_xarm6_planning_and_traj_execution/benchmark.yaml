description: 'A meta computational graph that uses [moveit2](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2)
  to compute motion planning and perform trajectory execution on a UFACTORY xArm6
  manipulator. Used to demonstrate a complex tranformation using the [geometry2](https://github.com/ros2/geometry2) package.
