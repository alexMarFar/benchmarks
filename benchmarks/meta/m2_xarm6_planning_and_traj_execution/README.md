# m2_xarm6_planning_and_traj_execution

Meta computational graph composed by xArm6 planning and trajectory execution

### ID
m2

### Description
A meta computational graph that uses [moveit2](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2)
to compute motion planning and perform trajectory execution on a UFACTORY xArm6
manipulator. Used to demonstrate a complex tranformation using the [geometry2](https://github.com/ros2/geometry2) package.
